> Easy: The maps are the easiest to be solved, and you will at least get 1 star even if you use a looooot of steps. <br>
> Gerneral: The maps are more difficult, and you will get zero star if you use more than a certain number of steps. <br>
> Hard: The maps are once more difficult, and there is a "Timer" added, if you can't solve it within the setting time, you lose. <br>
